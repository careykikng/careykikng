Carey is a Research Scientist at The University of Texas at Austin and Assistant Director at the Energy Institute. 

I perform interdisciplinary research related to how energy systems interact within the economy and environment as well as how our policy and social systems can make decisions and tradeoffs among these often competing factors. My research goals center on rigorous interpretations of the past to determine the most probable future energy pathways. I reach these goals by bridging the gaps between economic and biophysical (or ecological) worldviews of economic growth and structural change.
